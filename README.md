I disagree. Aster.js is JavaScript framework completely different from what you have ever
seen before.

It compiles your Aster.js code to [Solid.js](https://github.com/solidjs/solid).

See [test.aster](./code/test.aster) for an example.

## Before you begin:

Make sure you have [Deno](https://deno.land) installed on your system.

Also, install the following npm packages either in your home directory or
`npm init` a node package in the root folder of this repository and install them
there:

- solid-js
- vite
- vite-plugin-solid
- sass

```shell
npm i solid-js vite vite-plugin-solid sass
```

## How to start:

If you are on Windows, simply compile your Aster.js code by running
[`aster.bat`](./aster.bat) with the name of the folder where your
[aster.config.json](./code/aster.config.json) file is located as the first
parameter (Syntax: `aster <name of directory>`). In this case, the directory is
[code](./code/), so the command is:

```shell
aster code
```

You will then find the compiled HTML, CSS and JavaScript files in the
[build](./build/) directory.
